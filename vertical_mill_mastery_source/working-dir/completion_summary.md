## Key Improvements

1. **Educational Structure**: Transformed disconnected video content into
   progressive learning path with clear prerequisites and advancement

2. **Technical Depth**: Added engineering principles, mathematical
   relationships, and theoretical foundations missing from original content

3. **Professional Voice**: Elevated casual instructional tone to formal
   technical writing suitable for institutional use

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Combined split content (7a/7b) and organized
   into logical chapter progression

5. **Reference Quality**: Created documentation suitable for technical
   schools, apprenticeship programs, and professional reference
