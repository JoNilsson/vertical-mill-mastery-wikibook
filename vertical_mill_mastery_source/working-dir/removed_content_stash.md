## From Tutorial 04 - Basic Milling Operations

### Transcript Artifacts Found in Lines 49-67
Original conversational content that needs refinement:
```
material is moving this way and the cutters spinning this you can see that the
cutter is wanting to climb it's way up the hill of this cut that's exactly why
it's called climb milling but what's interesting is these two different
operations have very different cutting properties in conventional milling you
can see as I approach the curve of the previous cut this tooth here it starts
out on a very gentle slope and progressively eases it's way into the material
you can see how that would happen here and the tooth starts out rubbing and then
eventually as it keeps getting pushed into this slope it starts to become a cut
now over here on the climb milling side when this tooth impacts the material you
can see it's at a angle to the material and it's going to dig in immediately
start cutting there's no easing into the material it's biting in and starting a
chip immediately because of that better cutting action climb milling produces
better chips and also results in a better surface finish conventional milling
meanwhile because the cutter starts out rubbing the the cut doesn't start very
and you get a worse surface finish and you also get more wear on the cutter
given all that climb milling sounds the way to go but all you ever hear is it
climb milling bad conventional milling good that's what everybody says and it's
true and for one main reason and that's rigidity because of this climbing action
that the cutter is doing and climb milling the power of the mill is working
```

Technical content to preserve:
- Climb milling: cutter climbs up the workpiece, immediate cutting action
- Conventional milling: gradual engagement, starts with rubbing
- Climb milling produces better chips and surface finish
- Conventional milling causes more tool wear due to rubbing
- Climb milling requires rigidity to prevent grabbing
- Force directions differ between the two methods

against its own rigidity it's using its own power to push the cutter off track
there's a tremendous demand on rigidity one climb milling whereas conventional
milling because the cutter starts out with very low tool pressure and then as it
digs in it tends to pull itself into the material the rigidity demands of
conventional milling are much much lower and if you get aggressive with climb
milling cuts you can feel that climbing or that pulling on the table and you'll
know that feeling if you've come from a DIY or a woodworking background and
you've used a handheld router that when you use it in one direction it howls a
wounded banshee and when you use it in the climb milling direction it attempts
to murder you and that's how which is which on high-performance mills modern CNC
machines climb milling is preferable and the books will tell you to prefer climb
milling but the conventional wisdom says climb milling is bad because most of us
have older manual machines that don't have as much rigidity and for those
machines conventional milling is much better but we can get the best of both
worlds if we do most of our milling conventional and then when you need a really
good surface finish you can do a light finishing pass climb milling to get the
best possible finish much talking let's make some chips after a little more
talking I 'm going to do a conventional milling pass and then a climb milling
pass and remember that the cutter is spinning this way and milling cutters
always spin the same direction they spend clockwise when you're looking down on
them that's how I remember it and you'll see that if the material is moving this
way cutters spinning this way that's going to be a conventional mill and then if
the cutter is spinning of course the same direction and the material moves this
way that's going to be a climb mill here's the finish you can expect from
conventional milling it's smooth to the touch but under the macro lens you can
see these vertical ribs that are caused by the start of that chip formation
being a little funky and here's the finish from climb milling all the same
```

Key technical points:
- Climb milling requires much higher rigidity
- Conventional milling has lower rigidity demands
- Modern CNC machines can handle climb milling
- Older manual machines better suited for conventional
- Hybrid approach: conventional for roughing, climb for finishing
- Cutters rotate clockwise when viewed from above
- Surface finish differences visible under magnification

settings on the machine and you can see that the finish is much nicer you can
still see the tool box just barely but mostly what you now see is just the
horizontal grain in the aluminum assuming you have an average less than
superhumanly rigid mill the way I to remember which is better is that
conventional milling the cutter is fighting the direction of the material feed
whereas in climb milling it's following the direction of the material feed you
want to be a fighter not a follower and I find that you Nimonic useful because
it's easy enough to visualize climb milling versus conventional in two
dimensions on the bench but here in the heat of battle setup on the mill it can
be a little harder to wrap your brain around which direction the material is
moving relative to the teeth imagine the cutter always moving in slow motion
this and you can see that if I move the material this way you can see that that
material is following the teeth it's going with the teeth following that's climb
milling the material is moving this way you can see that it's resisting the
direction of the cutting teeth it's it's fighting the cutter be a fighter not a
follower we're going to talk about face milling first which is generally the

- "none of these are really huge deals but let's say we want to do better"
- "hopefully you can see that what we've done is technically squared up the ends of this slot"
- "the question is does this matter most of the time the answer to that is no"
- "our modification to the geometry of the ends there matters less than you might think it does"
- "this effect can be a feature too"
- "back on the part here if I run my gauge pin down to the end of the slot you can't even see or feel the out of roundness"
- "this technique is likely to get you close enough"

### Video-Specific References and Demonstrations Removed

- "what it allows you to do is find the center line of things"
- "but frankly end mills don't plunging that much to begin with"
- "that simple Act of pre-drilling the ends made a huge difference there"
- "a reasonable question then would be why don't we just continue that drilling idea all the way down the slot"
- "foreign on the final hole where there's too much overlap you can see the drill bit vibrating there"
- "here's a closer look these three holes in the middle here are ideal"
- "over here on the end where the holes were too close together you can see we've got a hot mess"
- "once again I 'm plunging at the end of the slot which goes very because. I 've got a nice pilot hole it's a hot mess pilot hole but pilot hole nonetheless"

### Major Transcript Section Removed from Lines 146-288
This extensive section contained significant conversational content that required complete rewriting:

```
first operation that you're going to do on a given part and it's also the most
common operation that you're likely to do on the vertical mill and it's most
basic level face milling is how we make things flat and that's a super power of
the vertical mill that makes things flat you might take something this here
which is a rough bandsaw cut it's very typical of what you're going to start
with because you're going to rough cut your stock to the very approximate
dimensions of the part you're going to be making and after face milling you get
a nice smooth machined surface this guy face milling turns this into this face
milling on the vertical mill is analogous to the facing cut that you start with
on the lathe it's the first operation that you're going to do it gives you your
first reference surface and then typically how on the lathe you would then turn
the outer diameter of the stock to some major diameter that's going to be the
basis for adding your features to the part on the mill we're going to face this
first surface and then we're going to typically square up the stock by face
milling all of the sides to get it to the rough outer dimension of our part upon
which we can then add features here's a selection of milling cutters that you
can use for face milling over here we've got your basic end mills and these come
in a few different flavors which we'll discuss here in a moment and then in the
center here we've got a couple of examples of shell mills which are great big
and Mel's except they have a hollow Center in them sometimes filled with jelly
and then over here we've got a fly cutter and then also a great option our face
mills these are typically going to be set up for carbide inserts and those are a
great option for larger machines for smaller home and hobbyist benchtop machines
I tend to prefer the high speed steel options I the shell mills and for a larger
surfaces the fly cutter let's take a closer look at the geometry of the humble
end mill it's the most common tool that you're going to be face milling with but
these guys are marvels of engineering and they are called end mills and they
have cutting edges on the end you might think that they cut on the end of the
end mill but in fact that's not really how these guys work let's say I 've got
this guy set up in the mill and I dial in some depth of cut and then I start
moving this guy across you can see how it's not really the bottom of the mill
that's doing any cutting it's really this front edge of the bottom of the flute
that's doing this cut the cutting this corner here and this edge depending on
how deep your depth of cut is if you're doing a 50 thousand let's talk about the
most visually obvious difference between different end mills that you're going
to find first is the color sometimes there's silver sometimes they're yellow
sometimes they're purple striped or whatever and they have different numbers of
flutes the most common you're probably going to encounter are two flute and four
flute what's all the differences here the color is generally some coating now in
this case this yellow color on these guys comes from the titanium nitride
coating that they have which is a very common entry-level coating for high-speed
steel mills and it just increases the hardness of the mill now you'll also find
other coatings to increase lubricity or increase wear resistance or lots of
other valuable properties and these coatings come in many many flavours and
they're about 80% science and 20% marketing but compare that to this silver
coloured mill here this is sometimes referred to as bright finish which is
marketing speak for cheap and this has no coating on it at all this is just raw
high speed steel and frankly not very good high speed steel at that this is a
low-budget end mill that you'll find on Amazon and yes this guy is going to wear
out and get dull much much quicker than these guys now let's talk about flute
count again the most common choices you're going to encounter are two and for
flute and this is certainly sufficient options for the home a hobbyist machine
shop there's no hard and fast rules about when to use 2 or 4 flute mills but
there are some general guidelines that you can go by each has strengths in
different situations the two flute mill gives you much more clearance between
the flutes and this is great for materials that tend to make stringy chips or
materials that are gummy or soft and need more time to get out of the way before
that next flute comes around during the cut and because of that extra chip
clearance the two flute mill is much less likely to clog up with material this
makes two flute mills a great choice for things aluminum brass copper and on -
flute mills are also a good choice when you need to do plunging into material
straight down this is not something that I to do but if you need to two flutes
are a better choice for that now you can get -called.

Center cutting mills in both flavors - for and and other flute counts but
regardless of that the two flute is always still going to be a better choice now
the for flute mill on the other hand has its own advantages the first is that
because there are more cutting teeth and engaged with the material at any given
time it's going to move material faster but one thing to be aware of is you
don't ever want more than two teeth engaged with your material at a time be
thinking about that as your flute count goes up on your mills the other thing
these extra flutes do is add rigidity a for flute mill is a great choice for
tougher materials steel you're going to be able to take deeper cuts because the
mill itself will be more rigid thanks to these extra flutes and for materials
where your rpm is lower more flutes is helpful because it allows you to get the
same amount of work done with lower rpm because you've got more teeth and doing
cutting on each lap around we'll start with this - flute mill because it's the
easiest to understand but the basic features are the same on on all end mills
you've got your spiral flutes here on the outside and similar to a drill they do
serve to evacuate chips but unlike a drill they evacuate chips outward not
upward and very much unlike a drill they are also cutting edges now on the end
here is where things get really interesting you've got two more cutting edges
here you can see on this particular mill the cutting edges along the bottom meet
at a point in the center and that's because this is a center cutting end mill
we'll talk about that a little bit later but at the business end here these
points here on the end or where all the action happens and you can see there's
these little scallops cut out of the end and then you can see there's an angle
here and an angle here and an angle here these are all relief angles to
understand the nml it helps to look at a basic lathe turning tools this is a
single point tool this point here is doing the cutting and then there's angles
here and here and here and the tool itself sits at an angle this there's all
these angles and these are all relief clearance and rake angles and they all
serve the same purpose which is to make sure that this point here is touching
the work and nothing else is and then there's also of course the rake angle
which helps to do the actual cutting but primarily it's just all about making
sure that only the part of the tool that you want doing the work is touching the
work you can think of the corners of the end mill as little tiny single point
lathe tools this point here is what's doing most of the heavy lifting and then
this little scoop cut out here behind the point this is the rake angle and this
is what's creating the angle at that point for the cutting action for the
material if you recall from grinding lathe tools you want I say a 10 degree top
break on your lathe tool for steel that's what this little scoop here is doing
same thing now here on the end we've got a clearance angle behind this point
here and then frequently you'll find a second surface behind that at a different
angle there will be a primary and a secondary clearance angle and that's because
clearance angles are always a trade-off between support and clearance you want
the clearance angles behind any cutting edge to be as shallow as possible
because that gives the cutting edge more support you want to support you want
material behind that cutting edge but the the less the angle is the less
clearance you have you want as much clearance as you can there's always a
tension there between those two goals one of the ways that we get around that is
by having multiple clearance angles high performance Mills really expensive
mills might even have three different surfaces behind every cutting edge to give
as much of a sweet spot between support and clearance as possible for comparison
here is a more expensive for flute mill and you can see this is not a center
cutting and amel the flutes don't meet at a web in the center but you can
clearly see we've got multiple clearance angles here behind the edges and
there's our rake angle there again behind the cutting point very clearly visible
and if you look closely here on the side flutes you can again see your cutting
edge and a clearance angle there anything the cuts has clearance angles but
that's not all you remember the lathe tool had clearances in all three
dimensions around that point again every single cutting surface and cutting
point on an end mill has clearance angles around it in all three dimensions
another area that shows up here is on the bottom and you might think that these
two bottom cutting edges are flat because in Mills make flat surfaces but in
fact there is an angle here they they dish into the center in fact this is
called the dish angle and it's a little hard to see but maybe this will help
that this block that I 'm holding is machined flat you can see the bottom
cutting edge is there don't touch it all the way across only the corners of the
mill are touching that surface that's the dish angle and this works very much in
the same way that a lathe can cut a perfect cylinder because it's a single point
cutting tool the points of this end mill are doing the cutting and as this guy
spins it's creating a halo of single point cutting tools effectively and as this
guy moves across the work it's a whole bunch of little single point cutting
tools spinning and they are creating a flat surface and then these inner areas
here or just trying to stay out of the way if these guys if you tried to make
them flat they'd end up gouging and touching the surface and the surface
wouldn't end up flat this little dish angle here is subtle a little bit of magic
now we've really just scratched the surface here on end mill geometry there are
land angles and helix angles and chip breakers and gash angles and there's much
more that goes into and.
