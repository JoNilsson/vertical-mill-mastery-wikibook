## Introduction

Success in machining operations depends not only on proper technique and
tooling but also on the systematic application of appropriate lubricants,
cutting fluids, and chemical products. This chapter provides a comprehensive
guide to the essential fluids and chemicals required for efficient shop
operations, covering selection criteria, application methods, and safety
considerations.

The modern machine shop requires a carefully selected inventory of
specialized chemicals, each formulated for specific applications and
material combinations. Understanding the properties and proper application
of these products directly impacts tool life, surface finish quality,
dimensional accuracy, and operational safety.

## Fundamental Categories

Machine shop chemicals fall into four primary categories:

1. **Lubricants**: Reduce friction and wear in mechanical systems
2. **Cutting Fluids**: Enhance machining operations through cooling and
   chip evacuation
3. **Protective Finishes**: Prevent corrosion and enhance appearance
4. **Adhesives and Sealants**: Provide permanent or semi-permanent
   component joining
5. **Marking and Layout Materials**: Enable accurate work positioning
   and measurement

## Primary Lubricants

### Way Oil (ISO 68)

Way oil represents the most critical lubricant in machine shop operations.
This specialized hydraulic oil, also designated as ISO 68, possesses unique
properties essential for sliding surface lubrication.

**Chemical Properties:**

- Viscosity index optimized for sliding surfaces

- Gear box applications (consult equipment specifications)

**Application Method:**
Way oil requires systematic application through dedicated oiling systems.
Ball oilers, common on modern equipment, use spring-loaded mechanisms that
seal against the oil delivery system. Proper technique requires:

1. Ensure oiler tip seals completely against ball oiler surface
2. Apply steady pressure until resistance indicates oil acceptance
3. Single pumping action typically sufficient for each lubrication point
4. Clean excess oil to prevent contamination accumulation

### High-Pressure Grease

High-pressure greases withstand extreme loading conditions where conventional
oils would be displaced. These lithium-complex or polyurea-based compounds
incorporate extreme pressure additives.
