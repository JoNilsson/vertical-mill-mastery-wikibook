## Why This License?

The CC BY-SA 4.0 license was chosen to:

1. **Preserve knowledge** - Ensure machining wisdom remains freely accessible
2. **Enable sharing** - Allow educators and shops to use and adapt the content
3. **Encourage contributions** - Let the community improve and expand the work
4. **Maintain openness** - Require derivative works to remain open

This aligns with the wiki philosophy: knowledge should be freely shared,
collectively improved, and preserved for future generations of machinists.
